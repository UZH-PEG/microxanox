Title: Oxic-anoxic regime shifts in microbial communities
Description: Model to simulate a three functional group system with four chemical substrates
  using a set of ordinary differential equations. 
  Simulations can be run individually or over a parameter range, to find stable states. The 
  model features multiple species per functional group, where the number is only limited by 
  computational constraints. The R package is constructed in such a way, that the results 
  contain the input parameter used, so that a saved results can be loaded again and thesimulation be repeated.
