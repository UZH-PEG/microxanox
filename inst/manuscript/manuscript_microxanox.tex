\hypertarget{motivation-and-significance}{%
\section{Motivation and
significance}\label{motivation-and-significance}}

Many ecosystems are exposed to gradual changes of environmental
variables, to which the responses are not always as gradual as the
change of the environmental variable. One example where the gradual
change of a single environmental causing an abrupt change of the system
is the switch from an aerobic to anaerobic system. This system hass been
investigated by Bush et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bush2017}{2017}). We
wanted to take this investigation one step further, and look at the role
of an increased biodiversity plays in these dynamics
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-REF_NEEDED}{REF NEEDED, 2222}). For this
purpose, we developed this package.

The microxanox package is a package for simulating a three functional
group system (\emph{CB}: cyanobacteria, \emph{PB}: phototrophic sulfur
bacteria, and \emph{SB}: sulfate-reducing bacteria) with four chemical
substrates (\emph{P}: phosphorus, \emph{O}: oxygen, \emph{SR}: reduced
sulfur, \emph{SO}: oxidized sulfur). It includes feddback between
biogeochemical processes and is based on
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bush2017}{Bush et al., 2017}) (See
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bush2017}{Bush et al., 2017}) for a detailed
discussion of the model).

The aims of the \texttt{microxanox} package are twofold. Firstly, the
package aims at reproducing the results shown by
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bush2017}{Bush et al., 2017}), which is
acomplished in the \href{LINK\%20NEEDED}{vignette Partial reproduction
of Bush et al}. Secondly, to take these results one step further, it
includes new functionality to adress our research question as presented
in (\protect\hyperlink{ref-REF_NEEDED}{REF NEEDED, 2222}).

For this, we extended the model and added functionality for:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Multiple strains (effectively unlimited) per functional group.
\item
  Adding temporally varying oxygen diffusivity.
\item
  Adding random noise in substrate concentrations.
\item
  Including immigration.
\item
  Setting minimum population abundances.
\end{itemize}

In addition to the model itself, the package includes some functions to
analyse the results as well as visualise the results to provide a
starting point for customised visualisations based on own requirements.

The package is not intended to provide a modelling framework which can
be adjusted easily to all needs, but primarily a tool to implement the
model used by (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bush2017}{Bush et al., 2017}) and
to extend it to our needs (\protect\hyperlink{ref-REF_NEEDED}{REF
NEEDED, 2222}). Consequently, any more substantial changes and
adaptaitions, are likely to need a change in the source code.

Nevertheless, the model is structured in a way which builds on a modular
structuere, so that e.g.~the event definition can easily be changed. or
other aspects can be adjusted. All values in the parameter object can be
changed as needed and the general structure of the code should make it
not to difficult to adapt the model to other similar systems.

\hypertarget{software-architecture}{%
\subsection{Software Architecture}\label{software-architecture}}

\{\textgreater\textgreater Give a short overview of the overall software
architecture; provide a pic- torial component overview or similar (if
possible). If necessary provide im- plementation
details.\textless\textless\}

The framework used when writing this package aims at reproducibility of
the results. It builds on the folowing main considerations:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  all parameter needed to run a simulation or find a stable state are
  contained in a single parameter object. This object is created by
  using the functions \texttt{new\_...\_parameter()},
  \texttt{new\_initial\_state()} and \texttt{new\_strain\_parameter()}.
  Which one of the \texttt{new\_...\_parameter()} functions has to be
  used when, will be discussed in the section @ref(runsim) and in the
  \href{LINK_NEEDED}{User Guide}.
\item
  The function call \texttt{run\_...(parameter)} will run the simulation
  using the parameter as defined in the object \texttt{parameter}.
\item
  The return value of the \texttt{run\_...(parameter)} function is
  identical to the parameter object plus an additionl slot named
  \texttt{results} which contains the results of the run
\item
  As this return value contains all parameter, it is possible to re-run
  the simulatuion by simply running \texttt{run\_...(result)}.
\end{enumerate}

The point that the results object contains all parameter needed to run
the simulation, promotes reproducibility and makes incremental changes
of individual parameters and re-running the simulations much easier.

A typical simulation would look as followed:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\hypertarget{software-functionalities}{%
\subsection{Software Functionalities}\label{software-functionalities}}

\{\textgreater\textgreater Present the major functionalities of the
software.\textless\textless\}

We will now discuss the general structure and functionality of the
package without going into to much detail. A more detailed discussion
can be found in the \href{LINK_NEEDED}{User Guide}.

The ODEs for the rates of change are specified in the function
\texttt{bushplus\_dynamic\_model()}. This augmented version of the model
published in (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bush2017}{Bush et al., 2017}) can
handle multiple strains within each of the three functional groups,
temporal variation in oxygen diffusivity, and events.

In the following sections we describe the general usage of the package:
running one simulation, finding steady states across an environmental
gradient, calculating measures of stability, and visualization.

\hypertarget{illustrative-examples}{%
\section{Illustrative Examples}\label{illustrative-examples}}

\{\textgreater\textgreater Present the major functionalities of the
software.\textless\textless\}

\hypertarget{running-one-simulation}{%
\subsubsection{Running one simulation}\label{running-one-simulation}}

The individual simulation (\texttt{run\_simulation()} function) is the
working horse in this package. In this function, the ODEs are solved.
The function needs only one argument - an object as created by the
function \texttt{new\_runsim\_parameter()}. One parameter of this object
is the \texttt{strain\_parameter} which can be created by the function
\texttt{new\_strain\_parameter()}. For a detailed description of the
parameter and how they are created please see the User Guide and which
acomnpanies the package or is available at \href{@LINK_NEEDED}{User
Guide}

After the parameter object has been defined, it can be used in the
\texttt{run\_simulation()} function. The function returns an object
which is identical to the parameter, except of an additional slot
containing the results. This design produces a fully reproducible object
as it can be used instead of a parameter object to be fed back into the
\texttt{run\_simulation()} function to run the simulation again from the
parameter used to generate the results from.

The function \texttt{plot\_dynamics()} plots a single simulation run, as
returned from the \texttt{run\_simulation()} function. This functio is
only provided as a convenience function to provide a way to easily see
the results of a simulation run. An example plot resulting from this
function is shown in @ref(fig:plot-dynamics).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=500px]{figures/ug_three_strains_dynamics} 

}

\caption{Plot of results of a simulation run using the function $plot_dynamics()$. Details can be found in the "User Guide" section "Three strains per functional group".}\label{fig:plot-dynamics}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{finding-a-steady-state-of-the-model}{%
\subsubsection{Finding a Steady State of the
model}\label{finding-a-steady-state-of-the-model}}

There are two methods for finding steady states. The first runs a
separate simulation for each combination of starting conditions and
oxygen diffusivity (let us term this the \emph{Replication method}). The
second runs only two simulations, with step-wise and slowly temporally
increasing or decreasing oxygen diffusivities and recorded of state just
before change to a new oxygen diffusivity (let us term this the
\emph{Temporal method}).

\hypertarget{replication-method}{%
\paragraph{Replication Method}\label{replication-method}}

The replication method is implementad in the function
\texttt{run\_replication\_ssfind()} which takes a parameter object as
returned by the function \texttt{new\_replication\_ssfind\_parameter()}
and the number of cores for multithreading the simulation.

\hypertarget{temporal-method}{%
\paragraph{Temporal Method}\label{temporal-method}}

The temporal method involves two simulations for a particular system
configuration (parameter set). In one simulation the oxygen diffusivity
is \emph{increased} in a step-wise fashion. In the other it is
\emph{decreased} in a step-wise fashion. That is, oxygen diffusivity is
held at a constant level for long enough for steady state to be reach,
that state is recorded, and then a slightly higher (or lower) oxygen
diffusivity value is set. Hence, at that time point, the system is
effectively started with initial conditions that are the state of the
system in the previous time step.

This is implemented in the function \texttt{run\_temporal\_ssfind()},
which takes a parameter object as created by the function
\texttt{new\_temporal\_ssfind\_parameter()} and a number indicating the
.

For a more detailed walk-through of these two approaches and explanation
please see the \href{@LINK_NEEDED}{User Guide}.

\hypertarget{extracting-stability-measures}{%
\subsubsection{Extracting Stability
Measures}\label{extracting-stability-measures}}

From the raw results returned by these \texttt{run\_...()} functions,
the stability measures can be extracted by using the function
\texttt{get\_stability\_measures()}. These measures include
non-linearity and hysteresis measures, of the response of the simulated
system to environmental change.

\hypertarget{impact}{%
\section{Impact}\label{impact}}

Indicate how widespread the use of the software is within and outside

The first two use cases are described in detail in the User Guide and
the Partial Reproduction Vignettes. The third is taken from the REF
NEEDED (\protect\hyperlink{ref-REF_NEEDED}{2222}) for which this R
package was designed. All of these use cases can be expanded to larger
numbers of strains per functional group and variable values van be
changed.

\hypertarget{regime-shifts-during-temporal-environmental-change}{%
\subsection{Regime shifts during temporal environmental
change}\label{regime-shifts-during-temporal-environmental-change}}

In the \href{LINK_NEEDED}{User Guide} we used a one strain system
(section ``1 strain per functional group'') and three strain system
(section ``3 strains per functional group'') to determine as an example
the stable states during temporal environmental changes (the oxygen
diffusivity). From these simulatiuons, we extracted measures of
nonlinearity and hysteresis. See Fig @ref(fig:plot-dynamics) as an
example plot of the simulations.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=500px]{figures/ug_three_strains_stable_state} 

}

\caption{Plot of the stable states of the simulation runs under different oxygen diffusivity. The top graph are the Organisms (ech initially with three strains) while the lower graph is the substrate availability under the same oxygen diffusivities.

\hypertarget{the-extent-of-hysteresis-depends-on-community-composition}{%
\subsection{The extent of hysteresis depends on community
composition}\label{the-extent-of-hysteresis-depends-on-community-composition}}

One of the reasons to develop this package was to reproduce the results
presented in Bush et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bush2017}{2017}), this
was achieved as demonstrated in the \href{LINK_NEEDED}{Partial
Reproduction supplement}. All aspects in the paper could be reproduced
and are shown in the vignette.

\caption{Hysteresis of all assessed combinations of variability.}\label{fig:user_guide_hysteresis}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{effects-of-functional-diversity-on-regime-shifts}{%
\subsection{Effects of functional diversity on regime
shifts}\label{effects-of-functional-diversity-on-regime-shifts}}

As discussed in the paper (\protect\hyperlink{ref-REF_NEEDED}{REF
NEEDED, 2222}), the role biodiversity plays in abrupt regime shifts
based on gradual changing environmental parameter is not well
understood. This model (as part of the package) has been used to
investigate these dynamics and the results are available in REF NEEDED
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-REF_NEEDED}{2222}).
