<p><strong>Response:</strong>: Done</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The authors in section 3.3 claim several sentences that could confuse readers. 2.1 <code>one discovers how the steady state of the system responds to the environmental conditions</code>. There are several concerns that the authors should clarify:</p>
<p>a)  <code>The steady state</code>. Is there a unique steady state? Is there a reported contribution concerning a formal analysis of the model in the sense of stability (stable state existence and uniqueness)? Maybe, authors should refer as <code>a system's stable state (if it exists)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Thank you for raising this important issue, which we had overlooked. A number of the reviewer comments below are closely related, hence we sometimes refer to this response and do so using the label &quot;Response R1&quot;. In order to clarify about the existence and uniqueness of steady states we have added the text <code>When one wishes to be able to make conclusions about how the steady state of the system is affected by the environmental driver, it is very important to note that the *final state* (found by the simulation) is not guaranteed to be a *steady state*. The user must ensure that the simulation is run for sufficiently long time for any transient dynamics to disappeared, and must also check the type of long-term dynamics occurring. In the results presented here, and in the paper @Limberger2022, this was performed by visual inspection, and by checking the sensitivity of conclusions to the length of the simulation. Furthermore, the package does not include methods for a formal analysis of the stability of the system and users should take care to assess if steady states are unique.</code></p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> In addition, we notice that we sometimes used the term &quot;stable state&quot; and sometimes &quot;steady state&quot;. We now use only the term &quot;steady state&quot;. Furthermore, we now use the term &quot;final state&quot; to refer to the state of the system at the end of a simulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>b)</code>The steady state of the system responds`. It should be noted that the steady state does not respond to the environment. Maybe, the authors refer to the numerical result of a steady state as a function of parameter and initial condition (if a steady state is not unique).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Thank you. We have edited the text so that we do not state that the steady state responds to the environment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2.2 <code>finding steady states that correspond to values of one environmental driver</code>. The software does not find a steady state. Maybe the authors refer to the software running an open loop of the dynamic system under a set of initial conditions and a subset of parameter values (oxygen diffusivity). Then, the numerical evaluation of steady states could be related to environmental conditions in real systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> We envisage and hope that Response R1 sufficiently clarifies steady state finding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2.3 <code>Two methods for finding steady states are implemented</code>. Again, the software does not find a steady state. Maybe the authors refer to two simulations proposed to evaluate an open loop simulation of the dynamic model numerically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> We envisage and hope that Response R1 sufficiently clarifies steady state finding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2.4 <code>The first runs a separate simulation for each combination of starting conditions and oxygen diffusivity</code>. This sentence is confusing. What the authors mean with <code>separate simulation</code> and <code>starting conditions</code>. Maybe the authors refer to each initial condition and parameter set value (oxygen diffusivity) as an open loop simulation run of the dynamic system. Are these simulations results focused on obtaining a bifurcation diagram Fig. 3 and 4 from {10.1038/s41467-017-00912-x}? Please clarified this point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> We have clarified what is meant by &quot;separate simulation&quot; by changing to &quot;independent simulation&quot;, and change &quot;starting conditions&quot; to &quot;initial conditions&quot;. We hope that this more standard terminology is clearer. Furthermore, we have added that &quot;This is the method used in the @Bush2017 study and was used to obtain the results in figures 3 and 4 of that article.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2.5 <code>The second runs two simulations, one with step-wise and slowly temporally increasing oxygen diffusivity, and the other with step-wise and slowly decreasing oxygen diffusivity</code>. This sentence needs to be clarified. Authors refer <code>temporally</code> as several changes in the value of oxygen diffusivity during a simulation run time. Maybe the authors mean the following: to explore the parametric sensitivity of the dynamic model under oxygen diffusivity variation, subset values of this parameter are numerically evaluated. Two value vectors of oxygen diffusivity are presented step-wise, gradually increasing and decreasing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> We are grateful for this different perspective on how to explain the method and have added it to the manuscript (&quot;Put another way, to explore the sensitivity of steady states of the dynamic model under oxygen diffusivity variation, subset values of this parameter are numerically evaluated. Two value vectors of oxygen diffusivity are presented step-wise, gradually increasing and decreasing.&quot;)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2.6 <code>We implemented two methods since there is no definitive best method, and in order to check if results were sensitive to choice of method</code>. This sentence is confusing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Thank you for pointing out this source of confusion. We change the text to &quot;Two strategies are implemented in order to allow comparison of their results.&quot; and moved it to just after we state that two strategies are provided.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a)  <code>two methods</code> Maybe the authors mean the following: two numerical strategies to explore a parametric sensitivity numerical evaluation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Thank you for this suggestions. We have changed the text to &quot;Two numerical strategies for finding steady states and their sensitivity to parameters are implemented.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>b)  <code>there is no definitive best method</code>. Under which criteria? The authors present only two numerical evaluations. Please clarified this point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> We have removed this claim since it is not demonstrated to be true and is unimportant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>c)  <code>in order to check if results were sensitive to choice of method</code>. This sentence needs to be clarified. There is no comparison between numerical evaluations in any sense. The numerical simulations or simulation results are not sensitive to choice or method. Indeed, the numerical solution of the dynamical model is sensitive to a set of parameters and initial conditions. Maybe the authors mean the following: to evaluate the performance of the numerical parametric sensitivity analysis of the dynamical model concerning one parametric variation (oxygen diffusivity) under two schemes.2.7 It is not clear why there are two <code>methods</code> for numerical parametric sensitivity analysis. The authors should include the arguments of this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> We removed this text and now simply state that having two methods allows the comparison of their results.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2.8 Please consider rewrite the section 3.3 (see previous 2.1 - 2.7 points) in the sense of Parametric sensitivity analysis, Open loop dynamical behavior, Equilibrium points (see Khalil, H. K. (2002). Nonlinear Systems. Prentice Hall, New Jersey.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> We have the opinion that the with the revisions already made and detailed above, and those below, that the terminology is now more in line with this text, and will be clearly understandable by the target audience (theoretical ecologists) even when the section is not more substatially rewritten.</p>
