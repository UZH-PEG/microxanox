Editor and Reviewer comments:





# Reviewer #1:
- 1. Please consider reference style: Number the references (numbers in square brackets) in the list in the order in which they appear in the text.

- 2 The authors in section 3.3 claim several sentences that could confuse readers.
    - 2.1 `one discovers how the steady state of the system responds to the environmental conditions`. There are several concerns that the authors should clarify:
         - a) `The steady state`. Is there a unique steady state? Is there a reported contribution concerning a formal analysis of the model in the sense of stability (stable state existence and uniqueness)? Maybe, authors should refer as `a system's stable state (if it exists)`.
         - b) `The steady state of the system responds`. It should be noted that the steady state does not respond to the environment. Maybe, the authors refer to the numerical result of a steady state as a function of parameter and initial condition (if a steady state is not unique).
    - 2.2 `finding steady states that correspond to values of one environmental driver`. The software does not find a steady state. Maybe the authors refer to the software running an open loop of the dynamic system under a set of initial conditions and a subset of parameter values (oxygen diffusivity). Then, the numerical evaluation of steady states could be related to environmental conditions in real systems.
    - 2.3 `Two methods for finding steady states are implemented`. Again, the software does not find a steady state. Maybe the authors refer to two simulations proposed to evaluate an open loop simulation of the dynamic model numerically.
    - 2.4 `The first runs a separate simulation for each combination of starting conditions and oxygen diffusivity`. This sentence is confusing. What the authors mean with `separate simulation` and `starting conditions`. Maybe the authors refer to each initial condition and parameter set value (oxygen diffusivity) as an open loop simulation run of the dynamic system. Are these simulations results focused on obtaining a bifurcation diagram Fig. 3 and 4 from {10.1038/s41467-017-00912-x}? Please clarified this point.
    - 2.5 `The second runs two simulations, one with step-wise and slowly temporally increasing oxygen diffusivity, and the other with step-wise and slowly decreasing oxygen diffusivity`. This sentence needs to be clarified. Authors refer `temporally` as several changes in the value of oxygen diffusivity during a simulation run time. Maybe the authors mean the following: to explore the parametric sensitivity of the dynamic model under oxygen diffusivity variation, subset values of this parameter are numerically evaluated. Two value vectors of oxygen diffusivity are presented step-wise, gradually increasing and decreasing.
    - 2.6 `We implemented two methods since there is no definitive best method, and in order to check if results were sensitive to choice of method`. This sentence is confusing.
         - a) `two methods` Maybe the authors mean the following: two numerical strategies to explore a parametric sensitivity numerical evaluation.
         - b) `there is no definitive best method`. Under which criteria? The authors present only two numerical evaluations. Please clarified this point.
         - c) `in order to check if results were sensitive to choice of method`. This sentence needs to be clarified. There is no comparison between numerical evaluations in any sense. The numerical simulations or simulation results are not sensitive to choice or method. Indeed, the numerical solution of the dynamical model is sensitive to a set of parameters and initial conditions. Maybe the authors mean the following: to evaluate the performance of the numerical parametric sensitivity analysis of the dynamical model concerning one parametric variation (oxygen diffusivity) under two schemes.2.7 It is not clear why there are two `methods` for numerical parametric sensitivity analysis. The authors should include the arguments of this.
    - 2.8 Please consider rewrite the section 3.3 (see previous 2.1 - 2.7 points) in the sense of Parametric sensitivity analysis, Open loop dynamical behavior, Equilibrium points (see Khalil, H. K. (2002). Nonlinear Systems. Prentice Hall, New Jersey.)
